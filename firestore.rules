/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a session-based security model for a real-time chat application.
 * Access to a session's content (participants and messages) is granted only to users who are active
 * participants in that session. Public discovery of sessions is allowed to facilitate joining via shared links.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized around a top-level `/sessions` collection. Each session document
 * contains two subcollections: `/users` for session participants and `/messages` for the chat history.
 * This hierarchical structure isolates each chat session, ensuring security and scalability.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Session Discovery: The list of sessions and individual session metadata are publicly readable to allow
 *   users to find and join sessions using a link.
 * - Session Management: Any authenticated user can create a new session.
 * - Session Participation: A user is considered a "participant" if they have a document in the
 *   `/sessions/{sessionId}/users` subcollection where the document ID matches their user ID. This check
 *   is the cornerstone of the security model.
 * - Content Access: Only session participants can read the user list or messages within that session.
 * - User Actions: Users can join a session (create their own user document), leave a session (delete their
 *   own user document), and send messages. They can only modify or delete their own user document and
 *   their own messages.
 * - Sub-Session Management: Authenticated users can create and view sub-sessions (voice channels).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The rules rely on checking for the existence of a user's document
 * in the `/sessions/{sessionId}/users/{userId}` subcollection to grant access to session content. This
 * `exists()` check is efficient and avoids reading entire documents, serving as a membership roster that
 * gates access to the `/users` and `/messages` subcollections.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: The use of distinct subcollections for `users` and `messages` under each
 * session provides clear separation of concerns and allows for granular, path-based security rules.
