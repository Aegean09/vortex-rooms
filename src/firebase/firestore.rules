/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a session-based security model for a real-time chat application.
 * Access to a session's content (participants and messages) is granted only to users who are active
 * participants in that session. Public discovery of sessions is allowed to facilitate joining via shared links.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized around a top-level `/sessions` collection. Each session document
 * contains two subcollections: `/users` for session participants and `/messages` for the chat history.
 * This hierarchical structure isolates each chat session, ensuring security and scalability.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Session Discovery: The list of sessions and individual session metadata are publicly readable to allow
 *   users to find and join sessions using a link.
 * - Session Management: Any authenticated user can create a new session. 
 * - Session Deletion: A session can be deleted by a user if they are the last one in the room. This is
 *   enforced by the client logic which performs a batch write. The rules allow a user to delete a session
 *   as long as they are signed in. The real security comes from the client-side check.
 * - Session Participation: A user is considered a "participant" if they have a document in the
 *   `/sessions/{sessionId}/users` subcollection where the document ID matches their user ID.
 * - Content Access: Only session participants can read the user list or messages within that session.
 * - User Actions: Users can join a session (create their own user document), leave a session (delete their
 *   own user document), and send messages. They can only modify or delete their own user document and
 *   their own messages.
